Yeah
Rick James, bitch
Party like I'm Rick James, bitch
Ride around, gettin' it
Blowin' money on my main bitch
Uh, bumpin' 2 Chainz,
bumpin' 2 Chainz (Woo)
In the Range Rove' (Woo),
ain't a damn thing (Ah)
Ain't a fluke, baby (Uh),
ain't a fluke, baby (Uh)
Cause the hook game got me
out the loot (Woo), baby
And I'm out of here
Racks on racks,
I'm a lot to serve (Serve up)
So fucked up
she gots to stare up
But she don't hear
what she don't wanna hear
Leanin', exercise,
I've been leanin'
Fifty side of me's dreamin'
Other of side me schemin'
Vibe with me, slide with me,
get high with me
Ridin' so clean, all night,
I've been
Vibin', slidin',
gettin' high, ridin'
So clean, all night,
I've been, I've been.
I've been waiting for you
To get high, get high,
get high with me, yeah
Ooh, woah
I must be dreamin'
(Dreamin', oh).
I must be dreamin'
(Dreamin'), oh-woah
I must be dreamin'
(Dreamin'), oh
I must be dreamin'
(Dreamin', oh)
Get high, get high,
get high, get high
Get high, get high, get high
I must be dreamin'
(When I'm dreamin', oh)
I must be dreamin'
(When I'm dreamin', oh)
They don't hear me, like
See my money in
Y'all mustn't hear me, like
So I can get inside of you
They don't hear me, like
I've already seen inside of you
Better hear me right, sorry now
Better hear me twice, sorry now
I'm dreaming
