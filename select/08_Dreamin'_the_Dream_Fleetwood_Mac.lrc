[00:24.02] There's a place
[00:29.17] I sometimes see you there
[00:35.16] It's a place that I visit
[00:38.95] Most every night
[00:46.95] 
[00:45.56] And I see your face
[00:52.21] Your eyes tell me you still care
[00:58.17] But it's suddenly over
[01:02.09] With morning's first light
[01:15.09] 
[01:09.96] As the day begins
[01:15.45] This feeling is going strong
[01:22.23] Sometimes the only thing
[01:29.15] That keeps me going on
[01:35.00] And until you find
[01:41.48] Your own way back to me
[01:47.44] I'll be forever
[01:54.80] Dreamin' the dream
[02:03.80] 
[02:25.44] As the day begins
[02:30.99] This feeling is going strong
[02:37.51] Sometimes the only thing
[02:43.96] That keeps me going on
[02:50.66] And until you find
[02:55.57] Your own way back to me
[03:04.02] I'll be forever
[03:10.46] Dreamin' the dream
