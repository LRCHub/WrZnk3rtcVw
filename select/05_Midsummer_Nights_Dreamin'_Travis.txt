Do it to me
Do it to me
Do it again

Takin' me high
Takin' me low
Takin' my friends

Think I'm a fool
Leavin' the school
Bendin' them rules

But do it to me
Do it to me
Do it again

Mid summer nights dreamin'
You might treat me right
Had too much to drink
Don't ask me now
Head in the sink

Do it to me
Do it to you
Do it to them

So much to see
So much to do
So little time

You're breakin' my heart
You're makin' me cry
You're stealin' my soul
You don't even try

But do it to me
Do it to you
Do it to them

Mid summer nights dreamin'
You might treat me right
Had too much to drink
Don't ask me now
Head in the sink
Girl!

Hey!

Mid summer nights dreamin'
You might treat me right
Had too much to drink
Don't ask me now
Head in the sink

Had too much
Too much
Had too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
Too much!
Too much!
Too much!
Too much!
Too much!
Too much!
Too much!
Too much!
Too much!
Too much!
Too much!
Too much!
Too much!
Too much!
Too much!

Girl!
