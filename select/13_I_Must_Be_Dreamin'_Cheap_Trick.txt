You must be dreamin'
You think i love you
You must be dreamin'
To think i love you

I'll never do it again
There i've said it again
Really mean it this time
Goin' down down down down

(Chorus)
You must be dreamin'
To think i love you
You must be dreamin'
To think i love you

Yeah you had me once
Oh once and maybe twice
Gonna break your heart
Let you down down down down

(Chorus)

When i (take it up) again
Now i'm out on a limb
I know i'll never do it again
There i've said it again
Really mean it this time

Oh my god god
Down down down down down

You must be dreamin
To think i love you

Gotta get out of here
If i'm gonna last
I know i'm losin' fast
I'm goin' down for the count

Couldn't face the day
I couldn't face another night
I'm sick of this shit
You bring me down down down

When i (take it up) again
Now i'm out on a limb
I know i'll never do it again
There i've said it again
Really mean it this time
Goin' down down down

(Chorus)

You must be dreamin'
You must be dreamin'
You must be dreamin'
